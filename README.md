# linux-setup-scripts


This repo contains personal Linux setup scripts  -- stuff that I frequently enough that I thought it might be worth sharing --  meant to be `curl`-ed 


### `setup-ohmyzsh`
This script is meant for a first setup of ZSH with common useful plugins:
1. Git: display current branch, status, commits
2. Autosuggestions: these are grabbed from history, use right arrow to accept. Super useful to retrieve previously used commands
3. Syntax highlighting: self-explanatory
Last but not least: the beautiful Powerlevel 10k theme

Usage:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedebotu/linux-setup-scripts/main/setup-ohmyzsh | bash
```
