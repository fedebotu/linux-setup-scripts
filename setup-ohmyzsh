# This script is meant for a first setup of ZSH with common useful plugins:
# 1. Git: display current branch, status, commits
# 2. Autosuggestions: these are grabbed from history, use right arrow to accept. Super useful to retrieve previously used commands
# 3. Syntax highlighting: self-explanatory
# Last but not least: the beautiful Powerlevel 10k theme
